# AB-Testing-of-Themes
This project performs A/B testing on website themes using Python, analyzing user interaction data to identify statistically significant differences in conversion rates, bounce rates, and session durations.
## **Project Title: A/B Testing for Website Themes**
**Dataset**: Light Theme and Dark Theme: Case Study from STATSO

**Overview**

This project conducts an A/B test to compare the performance of two different website themes (Light and Dark), evaluating their impact on user behavior and key metrics. By analyzing user interaction data, this project aims to identify the theme that is more effective in driving conversions, reducing bounce rates, and increasing user engagement.

**Key Objectives**

* **Compare Conversion Rates:** Evaluate which theme leads to higher conversion rates, indicating better user engagement and willingness to take desired actions.
* **Analyze Bounce Rates:** Determine which theme results in lower bounce rates, suggesting a more engaging and user-friendly experience.
* **Measure Session Duration:** Assess which theme leads to longer session durations, indicating higher user interest and satisfaction.

**Methodology**

1. **Data Collection:** Gather user interaction data for both themes, including metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, bounce rates, scroll depth, and session duration.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Prepare the data for analysis, handling missing values and inconsistencies.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Perform hypothesis tests (e.g., two-sample t-test, z-test) to compare the performance of the themes for each metric.
4. **Visualization:** Create visualizations to represent the findings and make the results more understandable.

**Tools and Techniques**

* **Jupyter Notebook:** Workspace for combining code, documentation and visualization.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For creating visualizations.
* **Statsmodels:** For hypothesis testing.

**Expected Outcomes**

* **Identify the Winning Theme:** Determine which theme performs significantly better in terms of the chosen metrics.
* **Provide Data-Driven Insights:** Offer valuable insights into the factors that influence user behavior and website performance.
* **Optimize Website Design:** Make informed decisions about website design and layout to improve user experience and achieve business goals.

**Future Work**

* **Expand Metrics:** Consider additional metrics such as time to first interaction or user satisfaction surveys to gain further insights.
* **Conduct More Iterations:** Run multiple A/B tests with different variations of the themes to refine the optimization process.
* **Explore Machine Learning:** Utilize machine learning techniques to predict user behavior and personalize the website experience.

By following this methodology and utilizing the specified tools, this project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of website themes on user behavior and performance, enabling data-driven decisions for optimizing the website and achieving business objectives.
